Zetta Playground
================

My playground for experimenting with Zetta as a home automation solution. Very much a work in progress.

See https://github.com/cjdell/esp-rf-switch for attaching an ESP8266 module to control switches.

Running
-------

    npm -g install ts-node
    npm install
    npm start
